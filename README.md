# osquery_hunter
osquery_hunter is a lightweight, Python-based triage helper for Windows systems. It uses osquery to enumerate running processes, network sockets, and signatures — helping analysts quickly spot unsigned or suspicious binaries. Ideal for DFIR, incident response, and blue-team investigations in environments without full EDR coverage.
